4. **Regular Audits**: Schedule quarterly documentation verification
5. **Automated Discovery**: Implement tools to auto-discover endpoints

### Documentation Standards

1. ✅ All claims must have source code evidence
2. ✅ Version control with correction notes
3. ✅ Clear disclaimers when features don't exist
4. ✅ "Future Enhancements" section for missing features
5. ✅ Independent reviewer sign-off required
