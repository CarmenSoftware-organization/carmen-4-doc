## Review Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Validation (2 days)

#### Step 1.1: API Endpoint Validation
**Objective**: Verify all documented API endpoints exist in source code

**Process**:
1. Extract all API endpoints from `api-reference.md`
2. Extract all `[Route("api/...")]` attributes from all controllers
3. Compare documented vs. actual endpoints
4. Identify:
   - ‚úÖ Documented and Implemented (GOOD)
   - ‚ùå Documented but NOT Implemented (FICTIONAL - REMOVE)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented but NOT Documented (GAP - ADD)

**Tools**:
```bash
# Extract documented endpoints
grep -r "POST\|GET\|PUT\|DELETE" docs/api/api-reference.md

# Extract actual endpoints from controllers
grep -r "Route(\"api/" ../Carmen4/Carmen.WebApi/Controllers/ -A 5

# Compare and generate gap report
```

**Output**: `API-ENDPOINT-GAP-REPORT.md`

#### Step 1.2: Controller Method Validation
**Objective**: Verify all documented controller methods exist

**Process**:
1. For each documented controller, extract method names
2. Read actual controller source code
3. Verify method signatures, parameters, return types
4. Flag mismatches

**Output**: `CONTROLLER-METHOD-VALIDATION.md`

#### Step 1.3: Business Rule Validation
**Objective**: Verify documented business rules match implementation

**Process**:
1. Extract all business rules from requirements documents (BR-AP-001, etc.)
2. Search source code for validation logic
3. Verify each business rule is enforced
4. Flag rules that are documented but not enforced

**Output**: `BUSINESS-RULE-VALIDATION.md`

## Risk Areas (High Priority for Review)

### Known Issues from Previous Validation
1. **AR Module - Sales Orders**:
   - STATUS: ‚ùå FICTIONAL - Already removed from requirements-validation-report.md
   - ACTION: Verify removal is complete across ALL documents

2. **AP Module - Excel/CSV Import**:
   - STATUS: ‚ùå FICTIONAL - Already flagged in requirements-validation-report.md
   - ACTION: Verify removal from all workflow and API docs

3. **AR Module - Credit Limit Enforcement**:
   - STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Field exists but not enforced
   - ACTION: Update docs to reflect actual implementation

4. **AR Module - Auto-Invoice from Contracts**:
   - STATUS: ‚ùå FICTIONAL - Already flagged
   - ACTION: Verify removal from all docs

5. **AP/AR Module - Automated Approval Routing**:
   - STATUS: ‚ùå FICTIONAL - Manual workflow only
   - ACTION: Update approval-workflows.md to reflect manual-only process

### High-Risk Document Areas
1. **Integration Documentation**:
   - Risk: May document integrations that don't exist
   - Action: Verify EVERY integration claim against actual controllers

2. **API Reference**:
   - Risk: 351 endpoints - high chance of fictional endpoints
   - Action: Automated validation of ALL endpoints

3. **Workflow Diagrams**:
   - Risk: May show fictional automation steps
   - Action: Manual trace of every workflow against controllers

4. **ERDs**:
   - Risk: May show fictional tables/relationships
   - Action: Compare against actual database schema
