## Fictional Features Detailed Analysis

### 1. Excel/CSV Invoice Import (AP Module)

**Requirement ID**: FR-AP-004.1
**Module**: Accounts Payable
**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Impact**: Productivity Limitation

#### Documented Claim
```markdown
**Invoice Import Capabilities**:
- System shall allow invoice import from Excel/CSV files
- System shall validate imported data before creating invoices
- System shall support bulk invoice creation from spreadsheets
- System shall generate error reports for invalid imports
```

#### Source Code Reality
```
‚ùå NO import endpoints found in ApInvoiceController.cs
‚ùå NO Excel/CSV parsing logic found in FncApInvoice.cs
‚ùå NO bulk import functionality exists
‚ùå NO file upload handlers for Excel/CSV
```

#### Evidence Trail
- **File**: `Carmen.WebApi/Controllers/ApInvoiceController.cs`
- **Search Terms**: "import", "Import", "excel", "Excel", "csv", "CSV", "bulk", "upload"
- **Result**: Zero matches - feature does not exist
- **Actual Routes**:
  - `POST /api/apInvoice` - Manual invoice creation only
  - No `/import`, `/upload`, or `/bulk` endpoints

#### Business Impact
- **User Expectation**: Users expect to import invoices from Excel for efficiency
- **Reality**: Manual entry only, significantly slower data entry process
- **Workaround**: Users must enter invoices one-by-one through UI
- **Productivity Loss**: Estimated 80% slower for bulk invoice entry

#### Affected Documents
1. `/docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md` (Lines 75-85)
2. `/docs/workflows/ap-invoice-workflow.md` (References bulk import)
3. `/docs/api/api-reference.md` (Claims import endpoint)

#### Recommended Action
- **REMOVE** all references to Excel/CSV import from documentation
- **ADD** to "Future Enhancements" roadmap if planned
- **UPDATE** training materials to reflect manual-only entry
- **NOTIFY** sales team to stop promising this feature

### 2. Automated Approval Routing by Amount (AP Invoice)

**Requirement ID**: FR-AP-004.3
**Module**: Accounts Payable - Invoice Approval
**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Impact**: Manual Workflow Inefficiency

#### Documented Claim
```markdown
**Automated Approval Routing**:
System shall automatically route invoices for approval based on amount:
- $0-$1,000: Optional approval (bypass allowed)
- $1,001-$10,000: Supervisor approval required
- $10,001-$50,000: Manager approval required
- $50,001-$250,000: Controller approval required
- $250,001+: Finance Director + CEO dual approval required

System shall:
- Automatically determine approver based on amount thresholds
- Send email notifications to assigned approvers
- Escalate if not approved within SLA
- Maintain audit trail of routing decisions
```

#### Source Code Reality
```
‚úÖ WorkflowController.cs exists (generic workflow engine)
‚úÖ Manual approval workflows supported
‚ùå NO automated routing by amount found
‚ùå NO threshold configuration exists
‚ùå NO automatic approver assignment
‚ùå Users must manually select approvers
```

#### Evidence Trail
- **File**: `Carmen.WebApi/Controllers/WorkflowController.cs`
- **Search Terms**: "amount.*threshold", "approval.*amount", "routing.*approval", "auto.*route"
- **Result**: Workflow engine exists but routing is MANUAL
- **Actual Behavior**: User submits invoice ‚Üí User selects approver ‚Üí Approval requested

#### Business Impact
- **User Expectation**: System will automatically route invoices to correct approver
- **Reality**: Users must know organizational hierarchy and manually select approvers
- **Risk**: Incorrect approver selection, delayed approvals, compliance issues
- **Efficiency Loss**: Manual routing adds 2-5 minutes per invoice

#### Affected Documents
1. `/docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md` (Lines 112-135)
2. `/docs/workflows/ap-invoice-workflow.md` (Shows automated routing diagram)
3. `/docs/workflows/approval-workflows.md` (Claims automatic routing)

#### Recommended Action
- **UPDATE** documentation to clarify manual approval selection
- **REVISE** workflow diagrams to show manual approver selection
- **CONSIDER** implementing automated routing if high priority
- **DOCUMENT** best practices for approver selection

---

### 3. Automated Payment Routing by Amount (AP Payment)

**Requirement ID**: FR-AP-005.2
**Module**: Accounts Payable - Payment Approval
**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Impact**: Manual Workflow Inefficiency

#### Documented Claim
```markdown
**Automated Payment Routing**:
System shall route payments for approval based on amount:
- $0-$5,000: Supervisor approval
- $5,001-$25,000: Manager approval
- $25,001-$100,000: Controller approval
- $100,001+: Finance Director approval required
```

#### Source Code Reality
```
‚úÖ ApPaymentController.cs exists
‚úÖ Manual approval workflows supported
‚ùå NO automated routing by amount
‚ùå Same manual workflow as invoices
```

#### Evidence Trail
- **File**: `Carmen.WebApi/Controllers/ApPaymentController.cs`
- **Search Terms**: Same as AP Invoice routing
- **Result**: Same workflow engine, manual routing only
- **Actual Behavior**: User creates payment ‚Üí Manually selects approver ‚Üí Approval requested

#### Business Impact
- **Impact**: Same as AP Invoice automated routing (see Feature #2)
- **Consistency**: At least both invoices and payments use same manual process
- **Risk**: Higher risk for payments than invoices due to cash disbursement

#### Affected Documents
1. `/docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md` (Lines 165-178)
2. `/docs/workflows/ap-payment-workflow.md` (Shows automated routing)

#### Recommended Action
