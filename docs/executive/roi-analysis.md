Net Benefit:       $200K (3-year period)
ROI:               7.3% (simple ROI)
```

**Note**: This understates true ROI as Year 3 benefits continue in subsequent years.

### Extended ROI (Including Year 4-5 Recurring Benefits)

```
Total Investment:  $2,750K (Years 1-3)
Maintenance:       $400K (Years 4-5 @ $200K/year)
Total Cost:        $3,150K

Total Benefits:    $2,950K (Years 1-3) + $4,040K (Years 4-5 @ $2,020K/year)
Total Benefits:    $6,990K
Net Benefit:       $3,840K
ROI:               122% (5-year period)
```
