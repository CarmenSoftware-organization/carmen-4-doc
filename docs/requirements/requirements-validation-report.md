### ‚ùå Fictional Features

#### 1. **Invoice Import from Excel/CSV** (FR-AP-004.1)

**Documented Requirement**:
```
- System shall allow invoice import from Excel/CSV
```

**Source Code Reality**:
```
‚ùå NO import endpoints found
‚ùå NO Excel/CSV parsing logic found
‚ùå NO bulk import functionality found
```

**Evidence**:
- Searched `ApInvoiceController.cs` for import/Import/excel/Excel/csv/CSV
- Searched `FncApInvoice.cs` for bulk/import/upload functions
- **Result**: No import functionality exists

**Impact**: **HIGH** - This is a significant feature gap

#### 2. **Automated Approval Routing** (FR-AP-004.3)

**Documented Requirement**:
```
System shall route invoice based on amount:

### 2. Add "Current Limitations" Section

Add to functional requirements document:

```markdown
## Current Implementation Limitations

### AP Module
1. **No Excel/CSV Import**: Invoices and payments must be entered manually
2. **Manual Approval Routing**: Approver must be manually selected (no automated routing by amount)
3. **No Purchase Orders**: System does NOT support PO matching or three-way matching

### AR Module
1. **No Sales Orders**: System is hospitality-focused with PMS integration, not traditional sales orders
2. **Credit Limit Not Enforced**: Credit limit is stored but not automatically checked or blocked
3. **No Auto-Invoice Generation**: Invoices must be manually created from contracts
4. **Manual Approval Routing**: Approver must be manually selected

### System-Wide
1. **Manual Approval Workflows**: All approval routing is manual, not automated by amount thresholds
2. **No Scheduled Jobs**: No automated background processing for recurring tasks
```

### 3. Create "Planned Enhancements" Section

Document future features separately:

```markdown
## Planned Enhancements (Future Versions)

### Phase 1 (Priority: High)
- Credit limit enforcement with blocking and alerts
- Excel/CSV import for AP invoices and payments
- Automated approval routing by amount thresholds

### Phase 2 (Priority: Medium)
- Auto-invoice generation from contracts (scheduled)
- Purchase Order management with three-way matching
- Automated recurring invoice generation

### Phase 3 (Priority: Low)
- Sales order management (if business model changes)
- Advanced workflow automation
- OCR for invoice data extraction
```

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

**HIGH IMPACT** - Fictional Features:
1. Credit limit enforcement (AR-001.2) - Financial risk exposure
2. Auto-invoice generation (AR-002.3) - Manual effort required
3. Sales orders (AR-003.1) - Wrong business model documented

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - Fictional Features:
1. Excel/CSV import (AP-004.1) - Productivity limitation
2. Automated approval routing (AP-004.3, AP-005.2) - Manual workflow inefficiency

### Documentation Impact

- **Accuracy**: Currently 60-70% accurate (30-40% fictional)
- **User Trust**: Risk of confusion and disappointment when features don't work as documented
- **Training**: Training materials may reference non-existent features
- **Sales**: Sales team may promise features that don't exist
